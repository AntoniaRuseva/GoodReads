IT Talents - Final Project
This is our final project from the IT Talents Trainig Camp. It is a RESTful Spring Web API for the backend of the Goodreads site.The original site is a popular social networking site for book lovers. Goodreads allows users to connect with other users, discover new books, and share their thoughts and opinions on books. Some of the main functionalities of Goodreads that we have implemented in our project include:
Friends: Users can make friends with other users and see what their friends are reading, reviews and challenges.
Reading: Users can add books to their "Want to Read", "Currently Reading", and "Read" shelves, as well as create custom shelves for other categories, such as "Favorites" or "Classics."
Challenges: Goodreads allows users to set reading goals for themselves, such as a certain number of books to read in a year.
Ratings and Reviews: Users can rate and review books they have read, which are used to generate recommendations for other users based on their reading preferences.
In addition to these features, we have also added the ability to follow other users and rate books, as well as the functionality for CRUD operations for Books, Shelves, Comments,Reviews and Challenges.
To use our API, simply send HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints for each feature. All the endpoints and their expected parameters are documented using Swagger and can be accessed by running the project and navigating to the following URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
We hope you enjoy exploring our Goodreads copy and look forward to hearing your feedback!
